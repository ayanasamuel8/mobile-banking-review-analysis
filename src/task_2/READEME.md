# task_2: Analysis & Feature Extraction

This module contains scripts for:
- Sentiment analysis (rule-based and transformer-based).
- Keyword extraction using TF-IDF.
- Clustering reviews into themes using unsupervised learning.

**Key scripts:**
- `sentiment.py`: Adds sentiment labels and scores using TextBlob.
- `transformer_sentiment.py`: Adds sentiment using a transformer model.
- `keywords.py`: Extracts top keywords and clusters reviews into themes.

Use these scripts in the analysis notebooks in `notebooks/`.
