## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd data-analysis-project
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook to run the analysis:
   ```
   jupyter notebook notebooks/analysis.ipynb
   ```

## Usage
- Use `src/main.py` to run the main data processing and analysis functions.
- Explore the Jupyter notebook in `notebooks/analysis.ipynb` for interactive data analysis and visualizations.
- Run the tests in `tests/test_main.py` to ensure the code is functioning as expected.
