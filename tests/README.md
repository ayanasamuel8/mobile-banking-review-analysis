# tests

This folder contains unit tests for all major modules in `src/task_1` and `src/task_2`.

- Ensure all preprocessing, analysis, and clustering functions work as expected.
- Run tests with your preferred test runner (e.g., `pytest`).

**Tip:**  
Add new tests when you update or add new features to the codebase.
